Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening

By Robert Frost
Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

My little horse must think it queer   
To stop without a farmhouse near   
Between the woods and frozen lake   
The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
To ask if there is some mistake.   
The only other soundâ€™s the sweep   
Of easy wind and downy flake.   

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,   
And miles to go before I sleep.



Eros of Bathing Stimming Dancing Pacing

Mostly I want to rake in the people
to understand the ways of pacing real thoughts
the feeling way

pace pace pace the talking
and type type type the thinking

and the two will rally
and become

Pace names the ways of thinking
and typing feels the ways of pacing

every string games
the perfect love in movement
in real relation
with inspirational rights
of people like me

Having the lust dancing in giving life to feel
the names of categories dancing
out of bounds
is amazing to play

and I get a thrill guessing
the way people will respond
to me and my open
languaging

language is the pavement answering
the way and I am the water
bathing and living
lustfully

Main idea in the eros of autism is the pace
dancing so I feel
fantastic like rallying ocean waves
carrying me like a boogie
board of puttering
on top of the warm water

Mind is lavishing
in the ideas in the eros
pacing
give me some examples

Love the power I have been bathing autistically
and living stimming dancing

the pacings
opening that field of thinking toward
artful liberation

from people who think autism is a problem
and janitors of diversity
live in that world

where simple cleanup
is bigger problem

lusting real ludicrous idea
that we need clean perfect people

I fastly make need
jumping always
on the page
